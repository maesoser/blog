Ey! It's Sergio. I am interested in:
- Network Protocols: (QUIC, BGP, Network resiliency, Congestion Control)
- Internet ecosystem (Web2/3, decentralized protocols, Information Theory)
- Microcontrollers (ESP32)
- Cybersecurity

I'm currently working for a cibersecurity company in London although I am originally from Spain. In my spare tiem I enjoy reading and taking pictures. On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in.

You can find my contact details at the bottom of this page, feel free to message me anytime!
