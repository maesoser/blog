Hi there! My name is Sergio and I'm a Telecommunications Engineer originally from Madrid. I have always had a strong interest in technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. That's why I decided to pursue a career in engineering, specifically in the field of telecommunications.

I'm currently working for a cybersecurity company in London, where I have the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to help protect businesses and individuals from online threats. I have a particular interest in network topics such as protocols, network resiliency, and network neutrality. I'm always eager to learn more about how networks work and how they can be made more efficient and secure.

In addition to my work in the telecommunications field, I'm also interested in the Web ecosystem and its new technologies like Web2 vs Web3, decentralized protocols, Information Theory applied to the Web, and cybersecurity. I'm always on the lookout for new application layer protocols like DNS over HTTPS, Oblivious DNS, and QUIC that can improve the way we access and use the Internet.

In my spare time, I enjoy building small robots or tools using microcontrollers like the ESP8266 or the ESP32. I find it really rewarding to see a project I've built come to life and perform a specific task. I also love reading and taking pictures. I find that these hobbies help me relax and unwind after a busy day at work.

On this blog, I'll be sharing some of the projects I'm working on as well as general topics that I'm interested in. I hope you find my posts helpful and informative. Thank you for visiting!
