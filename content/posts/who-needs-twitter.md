It wasn't because Elon Musk. 

After reading some articles[^1] I decided that it was time to reclaim my time and force myself to take some distance from social networks that are not extremely important to me. I removed Facebook years ago from my phone and it wasn't a big deal, why not evicting some others? 

Some applications like Whatsapp are important for me as they are often my main connection with my loved ones, my family my friends. However some others like LinkedIn, an employment-focused Social Network should not be taken any of my personal time or space in my phone. I had my doubts about Instagram but I'm too hooked to it and although several recently published studies[^2][^3][^4] show that it potentially affects mental health, in my case it gives me the opportunity to talk and keep connected with people that are not my closest friends.

I removed Twitter because is is one of the social networks in which I spend more time looking at what others write without actually writting something meaningful myself. Most of the time, when I re/tweet something I feel that what I'm doing is just contributing to the whole social tension and political polarization that seems to be well established in our societies now, and it even looks like it is not me, that it is a widespreaded effect[^5]. Compared to other apps twitter also became a lonely place in which no meaningful connection has been created in years at least in my case.

Instead, having a blog gives me the opportunity to think about what I'm going to write, doing some research about it, adding some context and even learn new things while gathering information to write it. And one important thing about this is that I'm not a Pulitzer. I'm not being paid for writting a blog. This is _my_ space, I own this. This doesn't need to be perfect as Kev Kirk explains in #100daystooffload[^6]. I just need to write when I feel up to it.

Hosting is not a problem. Right now there are plenty of options to host a blog. From nice and minimalistic SaaS solutions like [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) to serverless platforms like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing), passing through PaaS services like [fly.io](https://fly.io/) or [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/free/). Most of these options are free or have extremely generous free tiers that are enough for personal blogs.

In my case for obvious reasons I'm using Cloudflare Pages. The thing that Github now allows you to modify files from the browser makes thing super easy for me because that means that once the integration between [Github and Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-zola-site/) is done I can just edit or create pages in Github and my blog will be automatically compiled and updated in Cloudflare.
