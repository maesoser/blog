It wasn't because Elon Musk. After [reading some articles](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/) I decided that it was time to reclaim my time and force myself to take some distance from social networks that are not extremely important to me. I removed Facebook years ago from my phone and it wasn't a big deal, why not evicting some others? I kept the messaging apps that keep me connected with my family and friends: Whatsapp and Telegram. I doubted about Instagram but I'm too hooked to it and there is always a good excuse to talk and connect to people you don't usually see. LinkedIn and 

Twitter where the choosen ones because these are the ones in which I spend more time looking at what others write without doing something meaningful. Every time I tweet or retweet something what I feel I'm doing is just contributing to the whole social tension and political polarization that seems to be well established in our societies now. And compared to other apps, to me it also became a lonely place.
