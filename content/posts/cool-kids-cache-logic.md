**Akamai changing the name of Linode**

A few days ago Akamai revealed a change in the name of one of their most recent adquisitions: Linode was going to be known in the future as X. I'm not the only one who thinks that this cosmetic operation is far from causing any good to the current Linode offering, probably quite the opposite. But it is a good opportunity to try to see the whole picure and try to discover the reasons behind Linode's architecuture in the first place.

If we take a look at some movements in the market we'll see som interesting movements in regard to the so called serverless landscape. The concept of serverless is quite vague and it is often XXX. However it is much more than that. It comprises a different way of making web applications, a way that it is completely internet native and that position internet not as an interconnected network made by computer but rather like a big von-neumman computer itself.

That's the reason why if we've been seeing an important increase in serverless databases, in the interest of a small but really performant SQL integration (SQLite) and quite a significant bump in the valuation of a bunch of other serverless technologies like JS runtimes (deno, bun, workers, Hydrogen? ) and an (increment synonim) in the valuation and market cap of companies like fly.io or in the adoption of products like AWS Lambda√ü

**This is part of a bigger movement - show other movements, talk about serverless database space, valuation of plattform like fly.io, lambda expansion over time**

**Explaining what that movement is**

**Explaining what that movement means, the benefits**

**Akamai changing the name of Linode**

A few months ago, Akamai announced a name change for one of their recent acquisitions, Linode. The new name is X. While some people may not see this as a positive move for Linode's offering, it gives us an opportunity to examine the reasons behind Linode's architecture.

If we look at the broader serverless landscape, we can see some interesting movements. The term "serverless" is often misunderstood and oversimplified, but it represents a paradigm shift in web application development. It embraces an internet-native approach that treats the internet as a single, massive Von Neumann computer.

This larger movement has led to the rise of serverless databases, like SQLite, which offer small but highly performant SQL integration. It has also resulted in an increase in the valuation and market cap of companies like fly.io, as well as the adoption of products like AWS Lambda.

**This is part of a bigger movement:**

The serverless movement is not limited to specific technologies or platforms. It encompasses a shift towards a more efficient and cost-effective approach to building and deploying applications. Some other notable movements in this space are the growing popularity of serverless databases, the valuation of platforms like fly.io, and the expansion of AWS Lambda over time.

**Explaining what this movement is:**

The serverless movement involves designing and developing applications without the need to manage or provision servers. It relies on a pay-as-you-go model where cloud providers handle the infrastructure, scaling, and availability. Developers can focus on writing code and defining the business logic, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

**Explaining what that movement means (benefits):**

Embracing serverless architecture offers several benefits, including:

1. Reduction of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): With serverless, there is no need to invest in dedicated servers or worry about maintenance and operational costs. Cloud providers handle these aspects, leading to potential cost savings.

2. Reduction of infrastructure costs: Serverless allows you to scale resources dynamically based on demand. You only pay for the actual usage, avoiding the need to provision and maintain excess capacity.

3. Reduction of amortization of investment: Since serverless doesn't require upfront infrastructure investments, there is no need to amortize the cost of hardware or software over time. This can lead to faster return on investment for businesses.

**Conclusions:**

The serverless movement represents a significant shift in how applications are built and deployed. By leveraging cloud resources and offloading infrastructure management to providers, developers can focus on delivering value and innovation. This approach reduces costs, improves scalability, and streamlines development processes, ultimately benefiting both businesses and end-users. As the serverless landscape continues to evolve, it's essential for developers and organizations to stay informed and embrace this paradigm shift in order to remain competitive.
